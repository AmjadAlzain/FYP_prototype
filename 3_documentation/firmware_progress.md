# Firmware Development Progress Report

## 1. Initial State and Objective

The project began with a series of build failures related to the `espressif/esp32-camera` component and a complex, multi-component architecture. The primary objective was to refactor the project to use the official ESP-IDF Board Support Package (BSP) for the ESP32-S3-EYE, which would simplify the architecture and resolve the build issues.

## 2. Actions Taken and Architectural Changes

*   **Project Recreation**: The original firmware directory was deleted and a new project was created from the `espressif/esp32_s3_eye` BSP `get_started` example.
*   **Component Restoration**: The custom `model_data` and `embhd` AI components were restored to the new project.
*   **Dependency Management**: The `idf_component.yml` file was created and configured to use the `espressif/esp32_s3_eye_noglib` BSP and the `espressif/esp-tflite-micro` component.
*   **Code Integration**: The application logic, including the state machine and AI pipeline, was integrated into the `main/main.c` file.

## 3. Current Problem and Analysis

The build is currently failing with errors indicating that the `bsp_*` functions are not found. This is because the `esp32_s3_eye_noglib` BSP provides low-level drivers, but not the high-level convenience functions that are being called in `main.c`.

## 4. Next Steps

The next step is to modify the `main.c` file to use the low-level driver functions directly, instead of the non-existent `bsp_*` functions. This will involve re-implementing the hardware initialization and display drawing functions.
